<br>

There are many great RPA Extractors on GitHub; one of them is <a href="https://github.com/Lattyware/unrpa">UnRPA</a>. And once upon a time, I wanted to create a Discord chatbot that speaks exactly like Keitaro, however, none have written a dialog extractor specifically for Camp Buddy, so I wrote one <a href="https://github.com/lonewanderer27/Camp-Buddy-Dialog-Extractor">here</a>.

But still both of these tools are command line interface apps, meaning a user would have to know how to use a terminal which is not user friendly...
So I thought to myself.. why not combine these tools (and more that I can think of in the future) into an easy to use application?

Features:
* Preview and Extract the contents of an RPA file
* Extract dialogs of Camp Buddy characters onto a CSV file that can be used to make a Discord chatbot
