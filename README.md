## About The Project

<br>

I once wanted to create a Discord chatbot that speaks exactly like Keitaro, however, none have written a dialog extractor specifically for Camp Buddy, so I wrote one <a href="https://github.com/lonewanderer27/Camp-Buddy-Dialog-Extractor">here</a>.

However, that program is a command line application, meaning a user would have to know how to use a terminal which is not very user friendly... What if someone who's inexperienced in coding just wants to have fun with their friends, talking to Keitaro or Hiro in their Discord server, like I once wanted...

So I thought to myself.. why not make an app that can extract scripts from Camp Buddy? (and more that I can think of in the future)

#### Features:
* Preview and Extract the contents of any RPA file
* Extract dialogs of Camp Buddy characters and export it to a CSV file to make a Discord chatbot
